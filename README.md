# Express Note Taker

A note taker application using an Express backend. 

Using Express, a server is built for the application to run. A JSON file, `db.json` is used to store all notes, which contains objects with properties: id, title, and text.

Routes for each server request are created in order to handle the appropriate actions of viewing a note, creating a new note, and deleting a note. The HTML page will dynamically update upon each action. 

## Usage

The application is deployed using Heroku. Click [here]() to visit the application.
